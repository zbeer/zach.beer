A little bit about me.

## Core Values
These two words define who I show up as each day.  They have pros and cons, just as anything would.

### Integrity
I do what I say I'm going to do, or I tell you why I can't.  In real time, I can have difficulty relating to others who have other values.  Given time to reflect, I can empathize and understand their point of view.

### Achievement
If I embrace a goal, I will work tirelessly to achieve it.  This can sometimes make it difficult for me to change goals.  When I'm not at my best, it can make me competitive.  When it's a shared goal, I am a powerful positive motivator.  When my goal is in conflict with a larger goal, I can become disenfranchised.

## My [Enneagram](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com)
I make no claim that Enneagrams are a perfect tool or a complete representation of me.  It's one lens we can use to better understand each other.

I am a type eight ... 

> Eights are self-confident, strong, and assertive. Protective, resourceful, straight-talking, and decisive, but can also be ego-centric and domineering. Eights feel they must control their environment, especially people, sometimes becoming confrontational and intimidating. Eights typically have problems with their tempers and with allowing themselves to be vulnerable. At their best: self-mastering, they use their strength to improve others' lives, becoming heroic, magnanimous, and inspiring. [Source](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-8/)

... with a seven wing.

> Leaning into the charisma of Type Seven, an 8w7 attracts a dedicated following by articulating inspiring visions, encouraging people to tackle challenges, and offering protection. Eager to leave their mark on the world, they often excel as entrepreneurs, corporate executives, and political leaders.

## My [CliftonStrengths](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/home.aspx)
As with Enneagrams, I make no claim that CliftonStrengths is a perfect tool or a complete representation of me.  It's another view into our personalities.
1. __Relator__: People who are especially talented in the Relator theme enjoy close relationships with others.  They find deep satisfaction in working hard with friends to achieve a goal.
1. __Responsibility__: People who are especially talented in the Responsibility theme take psychological ownership of what they say they will do.  They are committed to stable values such as honesty and loyalty.
1. __Analytical__: People who are especially talented in the Analytical theme search for reasons and causes.  They have the ability to think about all the factors that might affect a situation.
1. __Individualization__: People who are especially talented in the Individualization theme are intrigued with the unique qualities of each person.  They have a gift for figuring out how people who are different can work together productively.
1. __Achiever__: People who are especially talented in the Achiever theme have a great deal of stamina and work hard.  They take great satisfaction from being busy and productive.

## Axioms
Things you will hear me say often and what they mean.

### "People fear change until they understand how change benefits __them__."
The example I often give is:  As your manager, I told you I was giving you a $10k bonus with no strings attached.  Sounds great, right?  Now what if I told you I was moving your workspace?  You immediately feel resistant, right?  It might be a much better space; you don't know.  Regardless, your instinct is to dig in your heels and resist... until you see the benefit.  As much as we'd like people to embrace changes for team and for organization, humans are self-centered.  Change is perceived to be inherently bad until it's clear that it isn't.

### "Seek first to understand, then to be understood."
Lifted from "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People".  In order to persuade others, you must first see things from their point of view.  Building on their frame of reference, you may be able to lead them to a different result.

### "You need another window in your metaphorical house."
Adapted from a previous therapist, Allison Cotton.  People see the world from their own metaphorical house.  Each person's house has some number of windows and some number of mirrors.  Windows represent the ways in which we see the world.  Mirrors represent the ways in which we see ourselves.  Lots of folks only have one window and no mirrors, meaning they only see things one way and don't have very much self-awareness.

### "People in a system will __generally__ only rise to what the system will hold them accountable to."
I'll freely admit that this is a cynical worldview, but one that I believe bears out in practice.  It is unreasonable to expect humans to do more than the system requires of them.  They may choose to do more, but that does not mean that we should expect it.  Likewise, if the system rewards people for a certain behavior -- they're going to tend towards that behavior.  We can say "so and so should do X" until we're blue in the face, but is anything holding that person accountable for doing what we believe they should do?  Are they incentivized to do that thing?  Probably not.  Let's not blame them, let's fix the system.

### "Slow is smooth, smooth is fast."

### "If your solution is memorization, you haven't solved the problem."
As humans, we have too much going on to assume we'll remember the right thing at the right time.  If we do, it's dumb luck.
